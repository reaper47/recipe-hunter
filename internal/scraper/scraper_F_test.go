The recipe was printed in New York Magazine (Jul 12, 2009).  If you don't have a pizza stone, this works well in a cast iron skillet.  The recipe requires very little time and effort but the dough must be started the day before.",

						{Type: "HowToStep", Text: "Divide the beef into four equal balls. Put a sheet of plastic wrap over a 4-inch ring mold on a cutting board or other hard surface. Put a ball in the middle of the mold and gently press down with the palm of your hand, forming a patty that is 4 inches wide. Pop it out with the plastic wrap.

(Why yes, that is a lot of butter, but it’s used to fully submerge the onion while it cooks; you will not eat 2 cups of butter in this burger.) Add the onion, turn the heat to low, and gently cook at a bare simmer until the onion is tender, about 20 minutes. The onion should be cooked but still al dente, so there’s some texture and a slight hit of sharpness yet not enough that you’ll taste onion the rest of the day. Remove the onion from the butter and drain on a paper towel."},

Smear the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter on the buns and place, butter side down, on the hot surface, working in batches if necessary. Toast until golden brown, 6 to 8 minutes, adjusting the heat if necessary. You want to do your best to time their completion to the burger cooking."},
						{Type: "HowToStep", Text: "While the buns toast, cook the patties. Heat a cast-iron skillet or grill over high heat. Use a spatula to handle the patty—it will be loose, so be careful.

					Value: "It took a lot of trial and error to find the right coating that would not draw out the moisture and would make the florets crisp, so I am pleased that it has turned out to be a very simple recipe. You will not need to add salt as the sauces have enough salt to season them. Either a smoky barbecue sauce or Frank’s hot sauce would work well, but if you are like me and prefer sweet and spicy, then try a little bit of both. Serve with ranch or Caesar dressing on the side if you wish, or whip up a batch of Spinach Ranch Dip. Note: The buffalo cauliflower bites will get softer once they are coated with the sauce, so hold off tossing until the very last minute",
