Then, place a heavy item* (I used a marble mortar but a can of food works) on top to apply pressure.Let it sit for at least 30 minutes before using. *The weighted item should not be so heavy that it will crumble or crush the tofu block but heavy enough that it will press out the tofu&#39;s liquid."},
