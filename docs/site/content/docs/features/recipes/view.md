to follow while cooking.

## Scaling

To scale a recipe, use the number input in the yield square to select the number of servings you want to make.

If you want to make more servings, enter a higher number.
If you want to make fewer servings, enter a lower number.

For example, the recipe above yields 6 servings. To double the recipe, set the number of servings to 12.
The recipe will then be automatically scaled to make 12 servings of oven roasted potatoes, as shown below.

:::caution

The scaling feature currently only scales ingredients, leaving instructions untouched. This
means that if an instruction mentions a specific amount of an ingredient, then that amount will
not be scaled. This limitation will be addressed in the future.
