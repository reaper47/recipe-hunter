The dropdown is organized in groups. Let's go over them.

## Recipes

You can export your recipes in the following formats.
1. JSON
2. PDF

The JSON format exports all your recipes in a zipped archive organized in a hierarchical manner, with each folder 
containing a JSON file of the recipe and an existing image. The recipe file follows the 
[Recipe schema](https://schema.org/Recipe) standard.

The PDF format exports all your recipes in a zipped archive. Each file in the archive follows the naming 
convention `{recipe name}.pdf`.
