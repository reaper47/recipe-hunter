# Integrations

Recipya offers integrations with other recipe manager applications. 

## Nextcloud Cookbook

[Nextcloud Cookbook](https://github.com/nextcloud/cookbook) is an app for [Nextcloud](https://nextcloud.com/). 
It stores recipes in the `.json` format following the [Recipe schema](https://schema.org/Recipe) standard. 
Therefore, all recipes can be imported into Recipya.

To do so, first navigate to where Nextcloud's recipes are stored in your computer. The path is written in
the [settings](https://nextcloud.github.io/cookbook/user/#where-are-my-files). Then, create a zip of
the recipe you want to import. Then, [import](/docs/features/manage/add#import) the zip file from Recipya.

:::note

We will eventually let the user import Nextcloud Cookbook recipes automatically. 
An [issue](https://github.com/reaper47/recipya/issues/74) is raised on GitHub.
