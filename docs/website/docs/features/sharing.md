# Sharing

A recipe can be shared to anyone who has the share link.

To generate the link, you first must [view a recipe](/docs/features/manage/view). Then, click the share icon to the right of the
recipe's title.

The link will be generated and displayed for you to copy, ready to be sent to your friends.

:::caution

- Clicking the copy button does not always work. An [issue](https://github.com/reaper47/recipya/issues/72) is raised on GitHub.
- The generated link is subpar when there are multiple users sharing the same recipe number.
