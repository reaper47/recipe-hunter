## Authentication

### Automatic Login

It is now possible to login automatically into the application. This is useful when user accounts are not needed. 

To enable this feature, set the **server.autologin** option in the configuration file to `true`. For Docker users, 
set the `RECIPYA_SERVER_AUTOLOGIN` environment variable to `true`.

A default account will be created on application start when no account has been
created yet. Its credentials are the following:
- **email**: admin@autologin.com
- **password**: admin

## Data

### Backups & Restore

Application data is now backed up automatically every third day.
It is possible to restore a previous backup.

Please consult the [features tour](/guide/docs/features/backups) for more information.

### Directory

The database has been moved from `path/to/recipya/` to `path/to/recipya/data/backup/database/`. This change allows
Docker users to persist the application's data. Users do not have to take any action because the migration to the new folder 
is automatic on application startup.

## Docker

Environment variables can now be passed through the `docker run` command and the `docker-compose` file.

## Cookbooks

Fixed an issue where the user could not access their cookbooks.

## TODO
The name of cookbooks is now automatically adjusted to title case. It is now not possible to create a cookbook named 
`best breakfast` when `Best Breakfast` exists because they have the same name.

## Recipes

### Import 

It is now possible to import recipe text files in the `.txt` format.
