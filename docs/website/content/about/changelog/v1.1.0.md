## Authentication

### Account Registrations

It is now possible to disable account registrations. This is useful when you wish to avoid random people registering an account when the application is exposed to the internet.

To disable user accounts, set the **server.noSignups** option in the configuration file to `true`. For Docker users,
set the `RECIPYA_SERVER_NO_SIGNUPS` environment variable to `true`.

You will be able to manage your users from the `/admin` dashboard.

## Admin

An admin page accessible via the `/admin` endpoint has been started.

### Automatic Login

It is now possible to login automatically into the application. This is useful when user accounts are not needed. 

To enable this feature, set the **server.autologin** option in the configuration file to `true`. For Docker users, 
set the `RECIPYA_SERVER_AUTOLOGIN` environment variable to `true`.

A default account will be created on application start when no account has been
created yet. Its credentials are the following:
- **email**: admin@autologin.com
- **password**: admin

## Cookbooks

Fixed an issue where the user could not access their cookbooks.

Fixed an issue where a cookbook without recipes could be downloaded.

### TODO
The name of cookbooks is now automatically adjusted to title case. It is now not possible to create a cookbook named
`best breakfast` when `Best Breakfast` exists because they have the same name.

## Data

### Backups & Restore

Application data is now backed up automatically every third day.
It is possible to restore a previous backup.

Please consult the [features tour](/guide/docs/features/backups) for more information.

### Directory

The database has been moved from `path/to/recipya/` to `path/to/recipya/data/backup/database/`. This change allows
Docker users to persist the application's data. Users do not have to take any action because the migration to the new folder 
is automatic on application startup.

### Jobs

The unreferenced images cleanup job now avoids deleting referenced cookbook images.

## Docker

Environment variables can now be passed through the `docker run` command and the `docker-compose` file.

## Infrastructure

Added a .devcontainer development environment. (document it)

Upgraded the Go version from 1.21 to 1.22. 

Updated all Go and NPM packages.

## Recipes

### Import 

It is now possible to import recipe text files in the `.txt` format. 
The text files should ideally be structured like the following:

```text
Title

Description

Metadata, like prep time, cooking time, total time, servings etc.

Ingredientslist
Quantity | Measurement unit | Ingredient | Possibly some instructions

Instructions

Possibly an URL where the recipe was taken from
```

## Reports

Reports are generated after importing recipes. They are accessible from the /reports endpoint.
Please consult the [features tour](/guide/docs/features/reports) for more information.

## System

### Memory Usage

Cut memory usage by half by removing the dependency on [Boostport/mjml-go](https://github.com/Boostport/mjml-go).
During the profiling analysis of the heap, it was observed that the application retained an instance of the of *wazero* in memory.
Recognizing  this behavior as undesirable, the package has been removed. In its place, a `build:mjml` command was added 
to the `package.json` file to convert `.mjml` files to `.gohtml` during the build process.

Further reduce memory usage by approximately 10% by using [templ](https://github.com/a-h/templ) instead of storing `gohtml` templates in memory.

## UI/UX

The entire frontend has been revamped to accommodate any device and feature a cleaner, more beautiful design.
