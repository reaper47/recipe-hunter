## Data

### Directory

The database has been moved from `path/to/recipya/data/backup/database/` to where user data is stored.
- Windows: `%APPDATA%\Recipya`
- Linux: `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/Recipya`
- MacOS: `$HOME/Library/Application Support/Recipya`

Users do not have to take any action because the migration to the new folder is automatic on application startup.

{{< callout type="warning" >}}
__Docker users__: 
Please ensure to adjust your volume path to
`recipya-data:/root/.config/Recipya`.
{{< /callout >}}

### Logs

A logging mechanism has been introduced using [log/slog](https://pkg.go.dev/log/slog). The logs are stored 
under `%APPDATA%\Recipya\Logs`. Logs rotate once a log file's size reaches 500MB. Up to three log files are stored at a time.

## Recipes

### Import

It is now possible to import recipes from Paprika. To do so:

1. [Export](https://www.paprikaapp.com/help/windows/#exportrecipes) your Paprika recipes in the `Paprika Recipe Format`.
2. Within Recipya, click the `Add recipe` button.
3. Click the `Import` button.
4. Select your `.paprikarecipes` file. You may also zip many `.paprikarecipes` together and select the resulting file.
5. Click `Submit`.

### View 

Fix missing closing parenthesis to the first column header of the nutrition table.

## Settings
