## Avatar Menu

Moved the link to the documentation from the about dialog to the avatar menu.

## Cookbooks

### Index

Mobile view now displays two columns instead of one.

## Data

### Directory

The database has been moved from `path/to/recipya/data/backup/database/` to where user data is stored.
- Windows: `%APPDATA%\Recipya`
- Linux: `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/Recipya`
- MacOS: `$HOME/Library/Application Support/Recipya`

Users do not have to take any action because the migration to the new folder is automatic on application startup.

{{< callout type="warning" >}}
__Docker users__: 
Please ensure to adjust your volume path to
`recipya-data:/root/.config/Recipya`.
{{< /callout >}}

### Logs

A logging mechanism has been introduced using [log/slog](https://pkg.go.dev/log/slog). The logs are stored 
under `%APPDATA%\Recipya\Logs`. Logs rotate once a log file's size reaches 500MB. Up to three log files are stored at a time.

## General

Fix a redirection error when logging in when a session cookie exists.

Most notifications are now sent through websockets instead of htmx, meaning all your open tabs will display the same sent notifications.

Prevented a data race condition caused by concurrent reads and writes to the sessions map.

## Recipes

### General

Calculate nutrition when the ingredients of a recipe are updated.

Support adding multiple pictures to recipes.

#### Engine

Deprecated the use of [Azure AI Vision](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-services/ai-vision) to digitize
recipes in favor of [Azure AI Document Intelligence](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-services/ai-document-intelligence)
because it is more accurate and accepts multiple file formats. 

**Important**: The *integrations.azureComputerVision* block in the configuration file and the 
`RECIPYA_VISION_ENDPOINT`/`RECIPYA_VISION_KEY` environment variables are deprecated and will be removed in v1.3.0.

To migrate:
1. Add the *Document intelligences* resource to your [Azure account](https://portal.azure.com/#allservices)
2. Access the resource.
3. From the sidebar, select *Keys and Endpoint* under *Resource Management*.
   ![alt text](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/document-intelligence/media/containers/keys-and-endpoint.png?view=doc-intel-3.1.0)
4. Copy *KEY 1* to your configuration file's **integrations.azureDocumentIntelligence.key** field or `RECIPYA_DI_KEY` environment variable if you use Docker.
5. Copy *Endpoint* to your configuration file's **integrations.azureDocumentIntelligence.endpoint** field or `RECIPYA_DI_ENDPOINT` environment variable if you use Docker.
6. Restart Recipya and test the *Azure AI Document Intelligence* connection from the settings.

**Limitations**

- For PDF and TIFF, up to 2000 pages can be processed (with a free tier subscription, only the first two pages are processed).
- The file size for analyzing documents is 500 MB for paid (S0) tier and 4 MB for free (F0) tier.
- If your PDFs are password-locked, you must remove the lock before submission.
