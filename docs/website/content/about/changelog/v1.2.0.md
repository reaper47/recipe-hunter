## Avatar Menu

Moved the link to the documentation from the about dialog to the avatar menu.

## Cookbooks

### Index

Mobile view now displays two columns instead of one.

## Data

### Directory

The database has been moved from `path/to/recipya/data/backup/database/` to where user data is stored.
- Windows: `%APPDATA%\Recipya`
- Linux: `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/Recipya`
- MacOS: `$HOME/Library/Application Support/Recipya`

Users do not have to take any action because the migration to the new folder is automatic on application startup.

{{< callout type="warning" >}}
__Docker users__: 
Please ensure to adjust your volume path to
`recipya-data:/root/.config/Recipya`.
{{< /callout >}}

### Logs

A logging mechanism has been introduced using [log/slog](https://pkg.go.dev/log/slog). The logs are stored 
under `%APPDATA%\Recipya\Logs`. Logs rotate once a log file's size reaches 500MB. Up to three log files are stored at a time.

## General

Fix a redirection error when logging in when a session cookie exists.

Most notifications are now sent through websockets instead of htmx, meaning all your open tabs will display the same sent notifications.

Prevented a data race condition caused by concurrent reads and writes to the sessions map.

## Recipes

### Add Manual

An unset yield now defaults to 1.

Missing required fields now throws an error.

Setting the category is now optional and defaults to 'uncategorized' when unset.

Setting the source is now optional and defaults to 'Unknown' when unset.

The description field is now optional.

### Categories

It is now possible to click the category of a recipe from the home page to display all recipes with the same category.

#### Subcategories

For example, the category `beverages:cocktails:vodka` means the following:
- `beverage` is the main category
- `cocktails` is a subcategory of `beverages`
- `vodka` is a subcategory of `cocktails` and

### Edit

### General

Calculate nutrition when the ingredients of a recipe are updated.

Fix some ingredient scaling issues.

Fix re-compressing images after every edit.

Only the first category is retained when inserting a recipe into the database.

Removed the `Crtl + /` shortcut to focus the searchbar.

#### Engine

Deprecated the use of [Azure AI Vision](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-services/ai-vision) to digitize
recipes in favor of [Azure AI Document Intelligence](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-services/ai-document-intelligence)
because it is more accurate and accepts multiple file formats. 

**Important**: The *integrations.azureComputerVision* block in the configuration file and the 
`RECIPYA_VISION_ENDPOINT`/`RECIPYA_VISION_KEY` environment variables are deprecated and will be removed in v1.3.0.

To migrate:
1. Add the *Document intelligences* resource to your [Azure account](https://portal.azure.com/#allservices)
2. Access the resource.
3. From the sidebar, select *Keys and Endpoint* under *Resource Management*.
   ![alt text](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/document-intelligence/media/containers/keys-and-endpoint.png?view=doc-intel-3.1.0)
4. Copy *KEY 1* to your configuration file's **integrations.azureDocumentIntelligence.key** field or `RECIPYA_DI_KEY` environment variable if you use Docker.
5. Copy *Endpoint* to your configuration file's **integrations.azureDocumentIntelligence.endpoint** field or `RECIPYA_DI_ENDPOINT` environment variable if you use Docker.
6. Restart Recipya and test the *Azure AI Document Intelligence* connection from the settings.

**Limitations**

- For PDF and TIFF, up to 2000 pages can be processed (with a free tier subscription, only the first two pages are processed).
- The file size for analyzing documents is 500 MB for paid (S0) tier and 4 MB for free (F0) tier.
- If your PDFs are password-locked, you must remove the lock before submission.

### Search

The page now does not reload when the search query is empty.

The search mode has been removed in favour of an advanced search.

Please consult the [docs](#/todo) to learn how to use it.
