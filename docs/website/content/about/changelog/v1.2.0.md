## Data

### Directory

The database has been moved from `path/to/recipya/data/backup/database/` to where user data is stored.
- Windows: `%APPDATA%\Recipya`
- Linux: `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/Recipya`
- MacOS: `$HOME/Library/Application Support/Recipya`

Users do not have to take any action because the migration to the new folder is automatic on application startup.

{{< callout type="warning" >}}
__Docker users__: 
Please ensure to adjust your volume path to
`recipya-data:/root/.config/Recipya`.
{{< /callout >}}

### Logs

A logging mechanism has been introduced using [log/slog](https://pkg.go.dev/log/slog). The logs are stored 
under `%APPDATA%\Recipya\Logs`. Logs rotate once a log file's size reaches 500MB. Up to three log files are stored at a time.
