## Basic Search

The basic search is one where the user types something in the search box without using any
of the advanced search concepts.

The default search mode is __Full search__. In other words, your query will search the following fields of all 
recipes belonging to you:
- Title
- Description
- Category
- Ingredients
- Instructions
- Keywords
- Source

The results will be ranked based on their relevance to the search terms.

## Advanced Search

The advanced search feature lets you tailor the search query to specific requirements. It is similar to using advanced
search features in google. For example, searching for `magnetic declination site:.edu` in Google will yield results 
containing the terms `magnetic declination` for websites of the `.edu` top-level domain.
