The program cannot be updated within the interface yet. If you wish to update the app, please download the nightly build and replace your existing `recipya.exe` with the one from the build zip.

Extract the zip once downloaded. Then, follow these [steps](#modify-configuration-file) to modify your configuration file.

Finally, start the server by opening a command prompt in the folder, and run the following command.

```bash
./recipya.exe serve
```

You can now access the website at the address specified.

#### Note for Windows users

If you intend to access the website on other devices within your home network, please ensure that the program is permitted through the firewall. To verify:
1. Open the "Firewall & network protection setting"
1. Click on "Allow an app through firewall"
1. Scroll down to recipya*.exe
1. Make sure private and public boxes are checked
1. Apply the settings
1. Find the IP address of your machine (Wi-Fi settings -> Click on the network you are connected to -> IPv4 address)
1. On your other device, access http://[IPv4 address]:[port]

### Docker

A Docker image called `reaper99/recipya` is produced nightly.

#### Using Docker

You first have to fetch it.

```bash
docker pull reaper99/recipya:nightly
```

Then, run the image. You must pass your `config.json` file to the container.

```bash
docker run -v path/to/config.json:/app/config.json -p [host port]:[port specified in config.json] -d reaper99/recipya:nightly reaper99/recipya:nightly
```

#### Using Docker Compose

You can use Docker Compose to run the container. First, you need to modify the ports
and the path to your local config.json in the [compose.yaml](https://github.com/reaper47/recipya/blob/docker/containers/compose.yaml).
Then, start the application.

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

Access the app through your browser at `http://localhost:[host port]`.

If you are using Windows and you intend to access the app on other devices within your home network, please ensure
to `Allow the connection` of the `Docker Desktop Backend` inbound Windows Defender Firewall rule.

### Manual Install

#### Windows

The `make` program is required to build the project. To verify whether it's installed on your machine, execute `make` in a command prompt or PowerShell.

Follow these steps if not installed:

1. Open either the Command Prompt or Powershell in administrator mode.
1. Execute `winget install GnuWin32.Make`
1. Add `C:\Program Files (x86)\GnuWin32\bin` to the Windows PATH environment variable.

---

Follow these steps to build the program:

First, clone the repository.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/reaper47/recipya.git
```

Go to the project directory.

```bash
cd recipya
```

Build the project.

```bash
make
```

Follow these [steps](#modify-configuration-file) to modify your configuration file.

Start the server.

```bash
.\bin\recipya serve
```

Finally, please ensure that the program is permitted through the firewall if you intend to access it on other devices within your home network.

#### Linux and macOS

There is no nightly build available for Linux and macOS. You will have to build it yourself.

First, clone the repository.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/reaper47/recipya.git
```

Go to the project directory.

```bash
cd recipya
```

Build the project.

```bash
make
```

Follow these [steps](#modify-configuration-file) to modify your configuration file.

Start the server.

```bash
./bin/recipya serve
```

### Modify Configuration File

Once the build zip is extracted or the project built, rename *config.json.example* to *config.json* and open the file to edit the following variables:
- **email.from**: The administrator's email address
- **email.sendGridAPIKey**: Your [SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com/) API key. The free tier should be sufficient for your needs.
- **port**: The port the app will be served through.
- **url**: The website the app is served on. This URL is used in the emails.


## Deployment

The project can be self-hosted. You first need to înstall the project [manually](#manual-install).

Then, create a service to run the app automatically on boot.

```bash
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/recipya.service 
```

Copy the following content to the newly-created file.

```bash
[Unit]
Description=Recipya Service
Wants=network.target

[Service]
ExecStart=/path/to/binary/recipya serve

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Start the service on boot.

```bash
sudo systemctl start recipya.service
sudo systemctl enable recipya.service
```
## Running Tests

Execute the following command to run the tests.

```bash
make test
```
