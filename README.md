# Recipya

Recipya is an application whose goal is to search for what you can cook with the ingredients in your fridge.
In other words, it helps you know what you can cook with what you have when you are out of ideas.

It works seamlessly with recipes in your [Nextcloud Cookbook](https://apps.nextcloud.com/apps/cookbook).

The project consists of a backend and a frontend.
The backend is a REST API. The frontend, found under the /web folder, is a simple app where the user can use the search function.

# Features
